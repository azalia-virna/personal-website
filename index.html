          I am a computer science student who is highly enthusiastic about gaining experiences both inside and outside of the campus. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively participated in various activities that have broadened my
          insights and skills, which I believe will be an asset in a workplace setting. One of my primary interests lies in web development, which has become the focal point of my skill development. I enjoy taking on new challenges and
          continuously deepening my knowledge and skills in web development.

          I am an active student who actively participates in programs offered by Kampus Merdeka. I have been a part of the campus accreditation team and have been actively engaged in local student organizations. As a computer science
          student, I have a keen interest in the field of software engineering. This is evident from my internship experience as a web developer and my pursuit of further knowledge through an independent study program focused on fullstack
          web development.
